# anomaly_detecter
Alerting system for the application

The system checks key metrics every 15 minutes, such as active users in the feed/messenger, views, likes, CTR, and the number of sent messages. 
In case of detecting an anomalous value, an alert is sent to the chat with the following information: the metric, its value, and the magnitude of the deviation.
